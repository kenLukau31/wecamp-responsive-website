# WeCamp – Responsive Website

## About the Project
WeCamp is a web development project and one of my first experiences building a complete website using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap.

The main goal of this project was to practice **responsive web design**, with a strong focus on using **CSS media queries** alongside **Bootstrap’s grid system** to ensure the site adapts well to different screen sizes and devices.

As part of the project, we also learned how to **deploy a website online**, and the final version was hosted on **Vercel**.
